Default package and Work X packages are the anwser to the assignments(Part II), all the five assignments score 100 points through the online test.
Other packages are the implementation of some classic algorithms introduced in the book.
The implementation in RedBlackBST(deleteMin, deleteMax and delete operations) and UnionFind(record height not size for weighteduf) is different from the book and from limited test I am not sure whether my implementation is correct or not.
I'm a student who plan to switch my major from Geography to Computer Science. 
Thanks for point errors and make progress together.

Coursera Algorithm4 Part2部分算法实现和assignments实现
五次assignments均通过correcness,memory和time的online test得到了100分,但还有诸多待优化
红黑树(删除最小,最大和一般)和并查集(判断如何merge的时候不是基于size而是基于height)的实现都跟原书中介绍的有些不同,有限的测试,尚不确定自己的方法是否正确,希望指正
地理系转专业学习的一枚渣~欢迎指正
